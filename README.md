#  Dual-grid system in Unity

#### This is a demo of how I implemented a dual-grid tilemap system in Unity 2022.3.42f1c1

Watched a vedio from Jess published on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEWFSv3ivTg&t=233s. Seem pretty good solutioin to cost less tiles. So I try to understand how the solution works, Although the video explained the principles of the entire work very well, I still took the time to study all the reference materials which posted by Jess ([ThinMatrix's video](https://youtu.be/buKQjkad2I0?si=9xot1uUw3PvNWvT9&t=234) and [See Oskar St√•lberg's original proposition of a dual-grid system](https://x.com/OskSta/status/1448248658865049605))  in depth. Based on my own understanding, I implemented it in code:
* Only use six tiles in the dual
* More suitable for my owner project
* Record the entire learning process and share 


### Mechanism

Regular tile cut:

On-the-dual tile cut:
